## SNAKE

This is a program that closely depicts the game "Snake Xenzia". Most of the functionalities are the same as the snake has to keep eating to get bigger while avoiding eating itself. 

## HOW TO RUN:

If using VSCode, the run option on the menu bar should get it running.

## HOW TO USE:
Once ran, it should show a main menu with the option to either play or exit. Pushing the exit button simply closes the program. Pushing on play starts the program and the up,left,right and down keys can be used to move the snake. The game will automatically close once the user fails.
